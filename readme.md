> Minimal state management library similar to `redux`, with `immer` built in.

## installation

```sh
# using yarn:
yarn add @converge/state

# or npm:
npm i @converge/state
```

## usage

```js
import { createStore } from '@converge/state'

const store = createStore({ count: 0 }, {
  plus: (by = 1) => state => { state.count += by },
  minus: (by = 1) => state => { state.count -= by },
  reset: () => () => ({ count: 0 })
})

const { plus, minus, reset } = store.getActions()

const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log(store.getState())
})

plus()
// -> { count: 1 }

plus(2)
// -> { count: 3 }

minus(2)
// -> { count: 1 }

reset()
// -> { count: 0 }

unsubscribe()

const { state, actions } = store.useStore()

console.log(state)
// -> { count: 0 }

actions.plus(10)

console.log(state)
// -> { count: 0 }

console.log(store.getState())
// -> { count: 10 }
```
